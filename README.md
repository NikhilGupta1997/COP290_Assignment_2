# Complaint Management App

## Overview
We were asked to design an **Android App** that would allow college students and faculty to register complaints at the **Individual**, **Hostel** or at the **Institute** Levels. The frontend was developed using **Android Studios** and the backend is a self written server in python. The frontend and backend communicate using the help of API calls.   

## Design Doc
Content of app and details of the frontend and backend can be found in the [Design Document](https://github.com/NikhilGupta1997/Complaint-Management-App/blob/master/DesignDoc/DesignDoc.pdf).
